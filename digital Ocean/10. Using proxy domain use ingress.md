**Yes, this will work — BUT only if you understand the flow correctly.
Let me explain clearly why and how.**

# ✅ **Answer: YES, you *can* use that proxy address**

Your proxy entry:

```
icsquizuserservice.deepseahost.com → http://159.89.172.251:30080
```

✔ **This is valid** because:

* `30080` = **Ingress NodePort (HTTP)**
* Your Ingress Controller listens on **NodePort: 30080**
* So any request arriving at `http://159.89.172.251:30080` goes to **Ingress Controller**
* Then ingress forwards the request to your backend service

# 📌 **Your Current Flow Using Proxy**

```
Client Browser
     ↓
https://icsquizuserservice.deepseahost.com
     ↓  (BT Panel Reverse Proxy)
Proxy → http://159.89.172.251:30080
     ↓
Kubernetes Ingress Controller
     ↓
Ingress Rule → / → icsquiz-user-service:3090
     ↓
Pods
```

✔ This is fully correct
✔ This matches your ingress-svc-custom.yaml
✔ This matches BT Panel proxy configuration

# 🧠 **Why this works**

Your ingress service:

```yaml
ports:
  - name: http
    port: 8080
    nodePort: 30080
```

Meaning:

| Where?            | Port  |
| ----------------- | ----- |
| Inside Kubernetes | 8080  |
| Node (External)   | 30080 |

So ANY external request must hit port **30080**.

Therefore:

### ✔ This works:

```
http://159.89.172.251:30080/student/api/users/all-users
```

### ✔ This also works through BT Panel proxy:

```
icsquizuserservice.deepseahost.com → http://159.89.172.251:30080
```

# ⚠️ **When NOT to use 30090**

30090 = your **backend NodePort**, NOT Ingress.

If you send:

```
proxy → http://159.89.172.251:30090
```

Then Ingress is **bypassed**, and backend service sees raw request like:

```
/student/api/users/all-users
```

Which may not match route OR rewrite rules.

But if you point to **Ingress** (30080), routing is handled correctly.

---

# 👍 **Conclusion**

### ✔ YES — you can safely use:

```
Proxy Address: http://159.89.172.251:30080
```

### This is actually **the correct and best practice** when using:

* BT Panel reverse proxy
* Kubernetes Ingress
* Custom NodePort ingress service
