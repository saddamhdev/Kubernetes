Let’s explain **exactly** what `300% / 70%` means in your HPA output:

```
cpu: 300% / 70%
```

This comes from:

```
CURRENT CPU USAGE / TARGET CPU USAGE
```

---

# 🔥 **1. 70% = Your HPA target**

You set:

```yaml
averageUtilization: 70
```

Meaning:

> Each pod should ideally use **70% of its requested CPU**.

Your pod’s CPU **request** is:

```
cpu: 100m
```

So:

```
70% of 100m = 70m
```

This is the CPU usage HPA wants.

---

# 🔥 **2. 300% = Actual CPU usage per pod**

300% means:

> Your pod is using **300% of its CPU request**.

Your request = **100m**, so:

```
300% of 100m = 300m actual CPU usage
```

### ✔ That means your pod is using:

**0.3 CPU core** each

---

# 🔥 **3. Why HPA scaled up to 3 pods?**

Because the rule is:

```
If CURRENT > TARGET → Scale Up
```

You had:

* **Current** = 300%
* **Target** = 70%

So CPU was **4.3× higher** than acceptable:

```
300 / 70 = 4.28
```

Therefore the HPA increased pods to handle load.

---

# 🧠 **4. Simple Explanation**

### **TARGET 70%**

→ “Keep pod CPU below **70%** usage.”

### **CURRENT 300%**

→ “The pod is using **3 times more** CPU than allowed.”

That’s why HPA scaled from 2 → 3 pods.

---

# 📌 Example Calculation from HPA

You have 100m CPU request.

Pod is using 300m:

```
(300m / 100m) * 100 = 300%
```

This is exactly what HPA shows.

# 🎯 FINAL MEANING OF `300% / 70%`

| Value    | Meaning                                                            |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **300%** | Pod using 3× more CPU than reserved (300m usage over 100m request) |
| **70%**  | HPA target; the ideal CPU usage (70m usage over 100m request)      |

Therefore:

> CPU load is very high → HPA scales up.

# If you want:

I can show how to **make CPU never cross 100% again** using:

✔ JVM tuning
✔ Lower HPA target
✔ Increasing CPU requests
✔ Increasing CPU limits
