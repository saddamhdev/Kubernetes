To check your **disk space**, run this command on your VPS:

---

# ✅ **Check total & free disk space**

```bash
df -h
```

Example output will look like:

```
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/vda1        80G   30G   48G  40% /
```

---

# ✅ **Check which folders are using space**

```bash
du -sh /*
```

This will show usage like:

```
4.0G   /var
2.3G   /usr
900M   /root
500M   /tmp
```

---

# ✅ **Check containerd / k3s disk usage**

K3s uses containerd, which often consumes many GB.

```bash
sudo du -sh /var/lib/rancher/k3s
sudo du -sh /var/lib/containerd
```

---

# ▣ **Send me your `df -h` output**

➡ Then I will tell you:

✔ If your disk is enough
✔ Whether you should increase swap
✔ If any folder is full
✔ Whether Kubernetes will crash from low storage

Just run:

```
df -h
```

and paste the result here.
